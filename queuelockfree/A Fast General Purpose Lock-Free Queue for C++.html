A Fast General Purpose Lock-Free Queue for C++
</a>
</h1>

<div class="post-body">
<p>So I've been bitten by the lock-free bug! After finishing my <a href="http://moodycamel.com/blog/2013/a-fast-lock-free-queue-for-c++">single-producer, single-consumer
lock-free queue</a>, I decided to design and implement a more general multi-producer,
multi-consumer queue and see how it stacked up against existing lock-free C++ queues.
After over a year of spare-time development and testing, it's finally time for a public release.
TL;DR: You can <a href="https://github.com/cameron314/concurrentqueue">grab the C++11 implementation from GitHub</a> (or <a href="#benchmarks">jump to the benchmarks</a>).</p>
<p>The way the queue works is interesting, I think, so that's what this blog post is about. A much more
detailed and complete (but also more dry) description is available in a <a href="http://moodycamel.com/blog/2014/detailed-design-of-a-lock-free-queue">sister blog post</a>, by the way.</p>
<h2>Sharing data: Oh, the woes</h2>
<p>At first glance, a general purpose lock-free queue seems fairly easy to implement. It isn't.
The root of the problem is that the same variables necessarily need to be shared with
several threads. For example, take a common linked-list based approach: At a minimum, the
head and tail of the list need to be shared, because consumers all need to be able
to read and update the head, and the producers all need to be able to update the tail.</p>
<p>This doesn't sound too bad so far, but the real problems arise when a thread needs to
update more than one variable to keep the queue in a consistent state -- atomicity
is only ensured for single variables, and atomicity for compound variables (structs)
is almost certainly going to result in a sort of lock (on most platforms, depending
on the size of the variable). For example, what if a consumer read the last item from
the queue and updated only the head? The tail should not still point to it, because the object will soon be freed!
But the consumer could be interrupted by the OS and suspended for a few milliseconds
before it updates the tail, and during that time the tail could be updated by another
thread, and then it becomes too late for the first thread to set it to null.</p>
<p>The solutions to this fundamental problem of shared data are the crux of lock-free programming. Often
the best way is to conceive of an algorithm that doesn't need to update multiple variables
to maintain consistency in the first place, or one where incremental updates still leave
the data structure in a consistent state. Various tricks can be used, such as never freeing
memory once allocated (this helps with reads from threads that aren't up to date), storing
extra state in the last two bits of a pointer (this works with 4-byte aligned pointers), and
reference counting pointers. But tricks like these only go so far; the real effort goes
into developing the algorithms themselves.</p>
<h2>My queue</h2>
<p>The less threads fight over the same data, the better. So, instead of
using a single data structure that linearizes all operations, a set of sub-queues
is used instead -- one for each producer thread. This means that different threads
can enqueue items completely in parallel, independently of each other.</p>
<p>Of course, this also makes dequeueing slightly more complicated: Now we have to check
every sub-queue for items when dequeuing. Interestingly, it turns out that the order
that elements are pulled from the sub-queues really doesn't matter. All elements from
a given producer thread will necessarily still be seen in that same
order relative to each other when dequeued (since the sub-queue preserves that order), albeit with elements
from other sub-queues possibly interleaved. Interleaving elements
is OK because even in a traditional single-queue model, the order that elements
get put in from from different producer threads is non-deterministic anyway (because
there's a race condition between the different producers). [Edit: This is only true if the
producers are independent, which isn't necessarily the case. See the comments.] The only downside to this
approach is that if the queue is empty, every single sub-queue has to be checked in
order to determine this (also, by the time one sub-queue is checked, a previously empty
one could have become non-empty -- but in practice this doesn't cause problems). However,
in the non-empty case, there is much less contention overall because sub-queues can be
"paired up" with consumers. This reduces data sharing to the near-optimal
level (where every consumer is matched with exactly one producer), without losing the
ability to handle the general case. This pairing is done using a heuristic that takes into
account the last sub-queue a producer successfully pulled from (essentially, it gives
consumers an affinity). Of course, in order to do this pairing, some state has to be
maintained between calls to dequeue -- this is done using consumer-specific
"tokens" that the user is in charge of allocating. Note that tokens are completely optional --
the queue merely reverts to searching every sub-queue for an element without one, which is
correct, just slightly slower when many threads are involved.</p>
<p>So, that's the high-level design. What about the core algorithm used within each sub-queue?
Well, instead of being
based on a linked-list of nodes (which implies constantly allocating and freeing or re-using
elements, and typically relies on a compare-and-swap loop which can be slow under heavy contention),
I based my queue on an array model. Instead of linking individual elements, I have a "block" of several elements.
The logical head and tail indices of the queue are represented using atomically-incremented integers.
Between these logical indices and the blocks lies a scheme for mapping each index to its block and sub-index within that block.
An enqueue operation simply increments the tail (remember that there's only one producer thread for each
sub-queue). A dequeue operation increments the head if it sees that the head is less than the tail, and
then it checks to see if it accidentally incremented the head past the tail (this can happen under
contention -- there's multiple consumer threads per sub-queue). If it did over-increment the head,
a correction counter is incremented (making the queue eventually consistent), and if not, it goes
ahead and increments another integer which gives it the actual final logical index. The increment of
this final index always yields a valid index in the actual queue, regardless of what other threads
are doing or have done; this works because the final index is only ever incremented when there's
guaranteed to be at least one element to dequeue (which was checked when the first index was incremented).</p>
<p>So there you have it. An enqueue operation is done with a single atomic increment, and a dequeue is
done with two atomic increments in the fast-path, and one extra otherwise. (Of course, this is discounting all
the block allocation/re-use/referencing counting/block mapping goop, which, while important, is not
very interesting -- in any case, most of those costs are amortized over an entire block's worth
of elements.) The really interesting part of this design is that it allows extremely efficient bulk
operations -- in terms of atomic instructions (which tend to be a bottleneck), enqueueing X items
in a block has exactly the same amount of overhead as enqueueing a single item (ditto for dequeueing),
provided they're in the same block.
That's where the real performance gains come in :-)</p>
<h2>I heard there was code</h2>
<p>Since I thought there was rather a lack of high-quality lock-free queues for C++, I wrote one using
this design I came up with. (While there are others, notably the ones in Boost and Intel's TBB, mine has more features,
such as having no restrictions on the element type, and is faster to boot.)
You can find it over at <a href="https://github.com/cameron314/concurrentqueue">GitHub</a>. It's all contained in a single header, and available
under the simplified BSD license. Just drop it in your project and enjoy!</p>
<p><a name="benchmarks"></a></p>
<h2>Benchmarks, yay!</h2>
<p>So, the fun part of creating data structures is writing synthetic benchmarks and seeing
how fast yours is versus other existing ones. For comparison, I used the Boost 1.55 lock-free
queue, Intel's TBB 4.3 <code>concurrent_queue</code>, another linked-list based lock-free queue of my own (a naïve design for reference),
a lock-based queue using <code>std::mutex</code>, and a normal <code>std::queue</code> (for reference against
a regular data structure that's accessed purely from one thread). Note that the graphs below
only show a subset of the results, and omit both the naïve lock-free and single-threaded <code>std::queue</code>
implementations.</p>
<p>Here are the results! Detailed raw data follows the pretty graphs (note that I had to use a <strong>logarithmic
scale</strong> due to the enormous differences in absolute throughput).</p>

Legend:
    'Avg':     Average time taken per operation, normalized to be per thread
    'Range':   The minimum and maximum times taken per operation (per thread)
    'Ops/s':   Overall operations per second
    'Ops/s/t': Operations per second per thread (inverse of 'Avg')
    Operations include those that fail (e.g. because the queue is empty).
    Each logical enqueue/dequeue counts as an individual operation when in bulk.

balanced:

  &gt; std::queue
     (skipping, benchmark not supported...)

Overall average operations per second per thread (where higher-concurrency runs have more weight):
(Take this summary with a grain of salt -- look at the individual benchmark results for a much
better idea of how the queues measure up to each other):
    moodycamel::ConcurrentQueue (including bulk):  16.69M
    boost::lockfree::queue:   4.07M
    tbb::concurrent_queue:   4.97M
    SimpleLockFreeQueue:   3.53M
    LockBasedQueue:  75.32k
    std::queue (single thread only):  84.37M
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see, my queue is generally at least as good as the next fastest implementation, and often much
faster (especially the bulk operations, which are in a league of their own!). The only benchmark that
shows a significant reduction in throughput with respect to the other queues is the 'dequeue from empty'
one, which is the worst case dequeue scenario for my implementation because it has to check <em>all</em> the
inner queues; it's still faster on average than a successful dequeue operation, though. The impact
of this can also be seen in certain other benchmarks, such as the single-producer multi-consumer one, where most
of the dequeue operations fail (because the producer can't keep up with demand), and the relative
throughput of my queue compared to the others suffers slightly as a result. Also note that the LockBasedQueue is
extremely slow on my Windows netbook; I think this is a quality-of-implementation issue with the MinGW <code>std::mutex</code>,
which does not use Windows's efficient <code>CRITICAL_SECTION</code> and seems to suffer terribly as a result.</p>
<p>I think the most important thing that can be gleaned from these benchmarks is that the total system throughput
<em>at best</em> stays roughly constant as the number of threads increases (and often falls off anyway). This means
that even with the fastest queue of each benchmark, the amount of work each thread accomplishes individually declines
with each thread added, with approximately the same total amount of work being accomplished by e.g. four threads and sixteen.
And that's the best case.
There is no linear scaling at this level of contention and throughput; the moral of the story is to stay away from designs that
require intensively sharing data if you care about performance. Of course, real applications tend not to be purely moving things
around in queues, and thus have far lower contention and <em>do</em> have the possibility of scaling upwards (at least a little)
as threads are added.</p>
<p>On the whole, I'm very happy with the results. Enjoy the queue!</p></div>
