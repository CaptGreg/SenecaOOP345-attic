A Fast Lock-Free Queue for C++

<time title="Posted February 07, 2013" class="timeago post-timestamp" datetime="2013-02-07T05:00:00Z" pubdate="pubdate">2 years ago</time>

<div class="post-body">
<p><span class="note">Update Nov 6, 2014:
    I've also just written a <a href="http://moodycamel.com/blog/2014/a-fast-general-purpose-lock-free-queue-for-c++">multi-producer multi-consumer lock-free queue</a>.
</span></p>
<p>Sharing data between threads in annoying. Really annoying.
If you do it wrong, the data is likely to become corrupted.
Even more error-prone is ensuring the shared data is perceived
in the right order (relative to other data reads/writes).</p>
<p>There are, as always, two ways to deal with this: The easy way, and
the hard way.</p>
<h3>The easy way</h3>
<p>Use the locks (e.g. mutexes, critical sections, or equivalent)
that come with your platform. They're not too hard to understand
conceptually, and even easier to use. You don't have to worry about
ordering problems, because the libraries/OS take care of that for you.
The only general problem with locks is that they tend to be slow
("slow" being relative here; for general use, they're plenty speedy enough).</p>
<h3>The catch</h3>
<p>I was looking into doing some audio programming, where the audio callback (which gets called
when the device needs more samples to fill its buffer)
was on another thread. The goal with audio programming is
to <a href="http://www.rossbencina.com/code/real-time-audio-programming-101-time-waits-for-nothing">never let the audio "glitch"</a> -- which means your callback code must be
as close to real-time programming as you can get on a conventional OS.
So, the faster things compute, the better, but what really matters with real-time
programming is how <em>deterministic</em> the computation time will be -- will your code
reliably take 5ms or could there be an occasional 300ms spike?</p>
<p>What does this mean? Well, for starters you can't allocate heap memory --
because that might involve an OS call, which might take a non-deterministic amount
of time to complete (e.g. if you have to wait for a page to be swapped to disk).
In fact, it's best to avoid calling into the kernel at all.
But, this actually isn't the main problem.</p>
<p>The main problem is synchronizing the audio thread with the main thread. We can't use locks,
because aside from non-negligible overhead (considering the frequency of callbacks), they
can cause <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Priority_inversion">priority inversion</a> -- you don't want a high-priority audio thread
waiting to enter a critical section that some background thread is obliviously taking
its time releasing, causing the audio to glitch.</p>
<h3>The hard way</h3>
<p>Enter lock-free programming.</p>
<p>Lock-free programming is a way of writing thread-safe code such that in the case
of contention, the system is guaranteed to advance as a whole. "Wait-free"
programming takes this a step further: the code is set up such that each
thread can always advance regardless of what the other is doing. This also
has the benefit of avoiding expensive locks.</p>
<p>Why doesn't everyone use lock-free programming? Well, it's not easy to get
right. You have to be very careful never to corrupt data under any circumstances,
regardless of what each of the threads are doing. But even harder to get right
are guarantees related to ordering. Consider this example (<code>a</code> and <code>b</code> start at 0):</p>
<pre><code>Thread A    Thread B
b = 42
a = 1
            print(a)
            print(b)
</code></pre>
<p>What are the possible sets of values that thread B could output? It could be any one
of {0 0}, {1 42}, {0 42}, and {1 0}. {0 0}, {1 42}, and {0 42} make sense (which one
actually results depends on timing), but how can {1 0} happen?
This is because the compiler is allowed
to re-order the loads and stores (or even remove some or invent others)
in order to improve efficiency, <em>as long as it appears to do the same thing on that thread</em>.
But when another thread starts interacting with the first, this re-ordering can
become apparent.</p>
<p>It gets worse. You can force the compiler to not reorder specific reads or writes,
but the <em>CPU</em> is allowed to (and does, all the time!) re-order instructions too, again as long it appears to do the
same thing on the core that the instructions are running on.</p>
<h3>Memory barriers</h3>
<p>Fortunately, you can force certain ordering guarantees all the way down to the CPU level using <a href="http://preshing.com/20120710/memory-barriers-are-like-source-control-operations"><em>memory barriers</em></a>. Unfortunately,
they are extremely tricky to use properly. In fact, a major problem with lock-free code is
that it's prone to bugs that can only be reproduced by specific non-deterministic interleavings of
thread operations. This means a lock-free algorithm with a bug may work 95% of the time and only fail the other 5%. Or
it may work all of the time on a developer's CPU, but fail occasionally on another CPU.</p>
<p>This is why lock-free programming is generally considered hard: It's easy to get something that <em>looks</em> right,
but it requires much more effort and thought to create something which is <em>guaranteed</em> to work under all circumstances.
Luckily, there are a few tools to help verify implementations. One such tool is <a href="http://www.1024cores.net/home/relacy-race-detector">Relacy</a>: It works by running unit
tests (that you write) under every possible permutation of thread interleaving, which is really cool.</p>
<p>Back to memory barriers: At the lowest level of the CPU, different cores each
have their own cache, and these caches need to be kept in sync with
each other (a sort of eventual consistency). This is accomplished
with a sort of internal messaging system between the various CPU
cores (sounds slow? It is. So it was highly optimized with, you guessed
it, more caching!). Since both cores are running code at the same time, this
can lead to some interesting orderings of memory loads/stores (like in the example above).
Some stronger ordering guarantees can be built on top of this messaging system; that's what memory barriers do.
The types of memory barriers that I found most powerful were the <a href="http://preshing.com/20120913/acquire-and-release-semantics">acquire and release</a>
 memory barriers.
A release memory barrier tells the CPU that any writes that came before 
the barrier should be made visible in other cores
if any of the writes after the barrier become visible, provided that the
 other cores perform a read barrier
after reading the data that was written to after the write barrier. In 
other words, if a thread B can see a new value
that was written after a write barrier on a separate thread A, then 
after doing a read-barrier (on thread B), all writes
that occurred before the write barrier on thread A are guaranteed to be 
visible on thread B. Once nice feature of acquire
and release semantics is that they boil down to no-ops on x86 -- every 
write implicitly has release semantics, and every
read implicitly has acquire semantics! You still need to add the 
barriers, though, because they prevent compiler re-ordering
(and they'll generate the right assembly code on other processor 
architectures which don't have as strong a memory-ordering model).</p>
<p>If this sounds confusing, it is! But don't give up hope, because there's many well-explained resources; a good starting
point is <a href="http://preshing.com/20120612/an-introduction-to-lock-free-programming">Jeff Preshing's very helpful articles on the subject</a>. There's also a short list of links in
<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/14185300/21475">this answer on Stack Overflow</a>. </p>
<h3>A wait-free single-producer, single consumer queue</h3>
<p>Since I apparently find tangents irresistible, I, of course, set out 
to build my own lock-free
data structure. I went for a wait-free queue for a single producer, 
single consumer
architecture (which means there's only ever two threads involved). If 
you need a data structure which is safe to use from several threads
at once, you'll need to find another implementation (MSVC++ comes with 
one). I chose this restriction
because it's much easier to work with than one where there's a 
free-for-all of concurrent threads, and because
it was all I needed.</p>
<p>I had looked
at using some existing libraries (particularly <a href="http://liblfds.org/">liblfds</a>), but I wasn't satisfied with the memory management (I wanted
a queue that wouldn't allocate any memory at all on the critical thread, making it suitable for real-time programming).
So, I ignored the copious advice about only doing lock-free programming if you're already an expert in it (how
does anyone <em>become</em> an expert like that?), and was able to successfully implement a queue!</p>
<p>The design is as follows:</p>
<p>A contiguous circular buffer is used to store elements in the queue. This allows memory to be allocated up front, and
may provide better cache usage. I call this buffer a "block".</p>
<p>To allow the queue to grow dynamically without needing to copy all 
the existing elements into a new block when the block
becomes too small (which isn't lock-free friendly anyway), multiple 
blocks (of independent size) are chained together in a circular linked 
list. This makes for
a queue of queues, essentially.</p>
<p>The block at which elements are currently being inserted is called the "tail block". The block at which elements are
currently being consumed is called the "front block". Similarly, within each block there is a "front" index and a "tail"
index. The front index indicates the next full slot to read from; the tail index indicates the next empty slot to insert
into. If these two indices are equal, the block is empty (exactly one slot is left empty when the queue is full in order
to avoid ambiguity between a full block and an empty block both having equal head and tail indices).</p>
<p>In order to keep the queue consistent while two threads are operating on the same data structure, we can take advantage
of the fact that the producing thread always goes in one direction in the queue, and the same can be said for the consuming
thread. This means that even if a variable's value is out of date on a given thread, we know what range it can possibly be in.
For example, when we dequeue from a block, we can check the value of the tail index (owned by the other thread) in order to
compare it against the front index (which the dequeue thread owns, and is hence always up-to-date).
We may get a stale value for the tail index from the CPU cache; the enqueue thread could have added more elements since
then. But, we know that <em>the tail will never go backwards</em> -- more elements could have been added, but as long as the tail
was not equal to the front <em>at the time we checked it</em>, there's guaranteed to be at least one element to dequeue.</p>
<p>Using these sort of guarantees, and some memory barriers to prevent 
things like the tail from being incremented before (or perceived as 
being
incremented before) the
element is actually added to the queue, it's possible to design a simple
 algorithm to safely enqueue and dequeue elements
under all possible thread interleavings. Here's the pseudocode:</p>
<pre><code># Enqueue
If room in tail block, add to tail
Else check next block
    If next block is not the head block, enqueue on next block
    Else create a new block and enqueue there
    Advance tail to the block we just enqueued to

# Dequeue
Remember where the tail block is
If the front block has an element in it, dequeue it
Else
    If front block was the tail block when we entered the function, return false
    Else advance to next block and dequeue the item there
</code></pre>
<p>The algorithms for enqueueing and dequeueing within a single block are even simpler since the block is of fixed size:</p>
<pre><code># Enqueue within a block (assuming we've already checked that there's room in the block)
Copy/move the element into the block's contiguous memory
Increment tail index (wrapping as needed)

# Dequeue from a block (assuming we've already checked that it's not empty)
Copy/move the element from the block's contiguous memory into the output parameter
Increment the front index (wrapping as needed)
</code></pre>
<p>Obviously, this pseudocode glosses over some stuff (like where memory barriers are placed), but the <a href="https://github.com/cameron314/readerwriterqueue">actual code</a> is not much
more complex if you want to check out the lower-level details.</p>
<p>When thinking about this data structure, it's helpful to make the 
distinction between variables that are "owned" by (i.e. written
to exclusively by) the consumer or producer threads. A variable that is 
owned by a given thread is never out of date on that
thread. A variable that is owned by a thread may have a stale value when
 it is read on a different thread, but by using memory
barriers carefully we can guarantee that the rest of the data is at 
least as up to date as the variable's value indicates when
reading it from the non-owning thread.</p>
<p>To allow the queue to potentially be created and/or destroyed by any thread (independent from the two doing the producing
and consuming), a full memory barrier (memory_order_seq_cst) is used at the end of the constructor and at the beginning of
the destructor; <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/q/13206148/21475">this effectively forces all the CPU cores to synchronize outstanding changes</a>. Obviously, the producer and
consumer must have stopped using the queue before the destructor can be safely called.</p>
<h3>Give me teh codes</h3>
<p>What's the use of a design without a solid (tested) implementation? :-)</p>
<p>I've <a href="https://github.com/cameron314/readerwriterqueue">released my implementation on GitHub</a>.
Feel free to fork it! It consists of two headers, one for the queue and a header it depends on which contains some helpers.</p>
<p>It has several nice characteristics:</p>
<ul>
<li>Compatible with C++11 (supports moving objects instead of making copies)</li>
<li>Fully generic (templated container of any type) -- just like <code>std::queue</code>, you never need to allocate memory for elements yourself
  (which saves you the hassle of writing a lock-free memory manager to hold the elements you're queueing)</li>
<li>Allocates memory up front, in contiguous blocks</li>
<li>Provides a <code>try_enqueue</code> method which is guaranteed never to allocate memory (the queue starts with an initial capacity)</li>
<li>Also provides an <code>enqueue</code> method which can dynamically grow the size of the queue as needed</li>
<li>Doesn't use a compare-and-swap loop; this means enqueue and dequeue are O(1) (not counting memory allocation)</li>
<li>On x86, the memory barriers compile down to no-ops, meaning enqueue 
and dequeue are just a simple series of loads and stores (and branches)</li>
<li>Compiles under MSVC2010+ and GCC 4.7+ (and should work on any C++11 compliant compiler)</li>
</ul>
<p>It should be noted that this code will only work on CPUs that treat 
aligned integer and native-pointer-size loads/stores atomically;
fortunately, this includes every modern processor (including ARM, 
x86/x86-64, and PowerPC). It is <em>not</em> designed to work on the DEC
Alpha (which seems to have the weakest memory-ordering guarantees of all time).</p>
<p>I'm releasing the code and algorithm under the terms of the <a href="http://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-2-Clause">simplified BSD license</a>.
Use it at your own risk; in particular, lock-free programming is a patent
minefield, and this code may very well violate a pending patent (I haven't looked). It's worth
noting that I came up with the algorithm and implementation from scratch, independent of any existing lock-free queues.</p>
<h3>Performance and correctness</h3>
<p>In addition to agonizing over the design for quite some time, I 
tested the algorithm using several billion randomized operations in a 
simple stability
test (on x86). This, of course, helps inspire confidence, but proves 
nothing about the correctness. In order to ensure it was correct, I
also tested using Relacy, which ran all the possible interleavings for a
 simple test which turned up no errors; it turns out this simple test
wasn't comprehensive, however, since I eventually did find a bug later 
using a different set of randomized runs (which I then fixed).</p>
<p>I've only tested this queue on x86-64, which is rather forgiving as 
memory ordering goes. If somebody is willing to test this code on 
another
architecture, let me know! The quick stability test I whipped up is 
available <a href="https://gist.github.com/cameron314/4728904">here</a>.</p>
<p>In terms of performance, it's <em>fast</em>. Really fast. In my tests, I was able to get up to about 12+ million <em>concurrent</em>
 enqueue/dequeue pairs per second!
(The dequeue thread had to wait for the enqueue thread to catch up if 
there was nothing in the queue.)
After I had implemented my queue, though, I found another 
single-consumer, single-producer templated queue (written by the author 
of Relacy) <a href="http://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/single-producer-single-consumer-queue">published
on Intel's website</a>;
his queue is roughly twice as fast, though it doesn't have all the 
features that mine does, and his only works on x86 (and, at this
scale, "twice as fast" means the difference in enqueue/dequeue time is 
in the nanosecond range). [Update: Mine is now competitive speed-wise 
with his.]</p>

    <h4>Update</h4><time title="Updated May 06, 2013" class="timeago" datetime="2013-05-06T05:00:00Z" pubdate="pubdate">2 years ago</time>

    <p>I spent some time properly benchmarking, profiling, and optimizing the code, using Dmitry's single-producer,
    single-consumer lock-free queue (published on Intel's website) as a baseline for comparison. Mine's now faster
    in general, particularly when it comes to enqueueing many elements (mine uses a contiguous block instead of separate
    linked elements). Note that different compilers give different results, and even the same compiler on different
    hardware yields significant speed variations. The 64-bit version is generally faster than the 32-bit one, and for
    some reason my queue is much faster under GCC on a Linode. Here are the benchmark results in full:</p>

    <p>In short, my queue is blazingly fast, and actually <em>doing</em> anything with it will eclipse the overhead of
    the data structure itself.</p>

    <p>The benchmarking code is available <a href="https://github.com/cameron314/readerwriterqueue-bench">here</a> (compile and run with full optimizations).</p>

    <a name="benchmarks-update"></a>
    <p><strong>Update update</strong> (May 20, '13): I've since changed the benchmark to preallocate the queues' memory, and added a comparison against
            <a href="https://github.com/facebook/folly/blob/master/folly/ProducerConsumerQueue.h">Facebook's folly::ProducerConsumerQueue</a> (which is a smidgeon faster but cannot grow as needed). Here are the results:</p>

    <p><strong>Another update</strong> (Jan 28, '15): I optimized my queue a bit further, vastly improving its cache-friendliness under heavy contention
    (using a trick inspired by the <a href="http://www.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/%7Epclee/www/pubs/ancs09poster.pdf">MCRingBuffer paper</a>).

    Note that my queue is now generally roughly comparable or 
significantly better than the SPSC and Folly ones, except when it comes 
to trying to dequeue
    from an empty queue, which the others can do faster. This skews the 
final average ops/s summary numbers a little, alas.
    (We're talking about single-digit nanoseconds here -- a "slow" 
failed dequeue operation with my queue still only takes 7ns, and that's
    on my 1GHz C-50 netbook processor.) The results in full:</p>

<h3>The future of lock-free programming</h3>
<p>I think that as multi-threaded code becomes more prevalent, more and more libraries will become available
that leverage lock-free programming for speed (while abstracting the gory, error-prone guts from the application
developer). I wonder, though, how far this multi-core-with-shared-memory architecture will go -- the cache coherence
protocols and memory barrier instructions don't seem to scale very well (performance-wise) to highly parallel CPUs.
Immutable shared memory with thread-local writes may be the future. Sounds like a job for functional programming!</p></div>
